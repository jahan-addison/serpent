# serpent

### Overview

A recharged take at "snake" for the VMU device's firmware, CPU, and LCD frame buffer as an experienced engineer. My first incomplete version from 15 years ago can be found [here](https://github.com/jahan-addison/epli/tree/throwback).

The CPU in the VMS _(dubbed, "the potato")_ is a customized Sanyo microcontroller which is code compatible with the LC86000 series.
The VMU flash memory contains 128 kilobytes of storage. These are divided into 256 blocks of 512 bytes each. Of these blocks, 200 are available for user files.
The rest of the blocks contain filesystem information, or are simply not used at all.

I have a fork of Marcus Comstedt's assembler that can be found [here](https://github.com/jahan-addison/comstedt-as).

## Build

### Requirements

- CMake ≥ 3.16
- bison and flex (required by the assembler)
- The `external/as` submodule initialised:
  ```sh
  git submodule update --init
  ```

### Steps

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

The game compiles to `build/serpent.vms`.
